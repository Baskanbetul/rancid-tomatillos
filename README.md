### Reflections
- During this project we learned how to research and implement new technologies in a short amount of time. By taking time to research what we needed from the new technologies we were able to implement them in a more timely manner.
- Although the learning curve for cypress was a bit steep at first, it was extremely rewarding.  Cypress made it possible to test error handling with our server, and made sure we could test different user flows.
